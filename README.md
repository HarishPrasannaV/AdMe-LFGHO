# AdMe
## Project Description
- AdMe is a social media app that rewards users through GHO tokens for paying attention and engaging with advertisements.
- We aim to create a fair social media platform where no one has a monopoly over advertiser revenue and ensure that users get paid a fair share for the attention they pay.
- Advertisers can publish their adverts by depositing a specific amount of GHO tokens and all the necessary details, such as an image/video URL. 
- For each token of GHO token deposited, an internal share called "Rewards" gets minted.
- An attention score is calculated based on the time the advert is visible on the user's screen and how they interact.
- Shares get internally allocated to users based on the attention score they've received for that particular instance of the advert.
- Once users have accumulated enough "Rewards" above the withdrawal threshold, they can withdraw them as GHO tokens to their account, and their corresponding internal shares get burned.
